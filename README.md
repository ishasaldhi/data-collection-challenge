# data-collection-challenge

## Background
In this project, I used web-scraping to scrape titles of news articles about Mars and previewing the text of the articles through automatic browsing using Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. After getting the news articles, I scraped data about weather on Mars. Lastly, I analyzed the number of months on Mars and how they related to terrestrial dates as well creating visualizations for the highest and lowest temperatures and atmospheric pressures on Mars.

## Features 
* Using Splinter and HTML parsing through Beautiful Soup to scrape news articles about Mars and weather data
* Creating a Pandas DataFrame with the Weather data in Jupyter Notebook
* Analyze DataFrame by months, terrestrial dates, temperature, and atmospheric pressure
* Create Visualizations for the highest and lowest temperatures and atmospheric pressures using Matplotlib
